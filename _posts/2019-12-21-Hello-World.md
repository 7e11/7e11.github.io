title: Why does this blog exist?
---

I've always wanted to start a blog where I go in depth on some CS topics which interest me.

I remember reading awful medium articles while researching DQN for a reinforcement learning class. My goal is that everything in this blog is well researched and highly polished.


This list of topics will be expanded

- Transactional Memory (Maybe)
- Deep Learning (Unlikely)
- Obscure language features
- Projects I'm working on
  - Coursesite autograder
  - Coursesite/piazza scraper
- Interesting things we went over in class
  - Algorithms: Jon Bently lecture
  - OS: Some of the weird problems Spear talked about. Look back at notes.
- osu! stuff: python based DB reader, mp3 extractor, data vis/analysis?
  - They have an API also, check that out
