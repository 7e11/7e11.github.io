title: Why does this blog exist?
---

I've always wanted to start a blog where I go in depth on some CS topics which interest me.

I remeber reading awful medium articles while researching DQN for a reinforcement learning class. I wanted to make a blog where everything is well researched and highly polished.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
