title: Why does this blog exist?
---

I've always wanted to start a blog where I go in depth on some CS topics which interest me.

I remeber reading awful medium articles while researching DQN for a reinforcement learning class. My goal is that everything in this blog is well researched and highly polished.

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
